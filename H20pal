H20 Pal

Cons:
1. Cannot be used while running.But due to the way H2O-Pal works it will only record your intake once you
 set it on a flat surface, so it's not ideal, especially for outside running.

2. This cannot be used in bicycle, hiking, obstacle course training.

3. Doesn't fit in cup holders

4. Not dishwasher safe.

5. Scale doesn't register the last few ounces at the bottom of the bottle.

6. Initially the product worked okay, but after 4 weeks failed.

7.Don't use with carbonated water/drinks.

8. It will not beep if you move out of distance.

9. It cannot pair 2 bottles with same phone.

Pros:
1. Natural feel to it and the rubber makes it very easy to grip.

2. The bottle is glass, which is so much better than plastic.

3. Replacement is good.

4. Charge for 6 months
